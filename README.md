# Simple-Machine-Learning-Model-
This Python Notebook uses simple machine learning techniques to train a model and predict values for a simple mathematical equation. It uses a series of data points that uses the equation Y = (C1)a + (C2)b + (C3)c in order to guess what the coefficients are in order to predict what the Y value will be.
